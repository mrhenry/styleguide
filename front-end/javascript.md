# Javascript

We're going full Angular for everything.

Read up on our default packages: `fd-angular-core`, `fd-angular-tmpl`, `fd-angular-meta`, `mr-angular-pages`.

### Best practices

There's so much already written about this that it'd be a waste of time to do it all again. Best practices like using `===` over `==` unless you know what you're doing are considered known. An amazingly good extensive guide is written by the guys over at [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

### A few guidelines

 - We write ES6 (some ES7 features) compiled with Babel, handled through JSPM
 - Indent with one tab
 - `camelCase` functions and variables; constants go in ALL_CAPS_SEPARATED with an underscore

### Boilerplate

Check out a website like MUHKA on Bitbucket as a reference, this has up to date best practices & code examples.
